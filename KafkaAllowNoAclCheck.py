        If a resource has no associated ACLs and allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found=true, then anyone is allowed to access that resource.
        If allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found=false, then no one is allowed to access that resource except super users.
        Use of the allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found configuration option in production environments is strongly discouraged.
        - If you specify this option based on the assumption that you have ACLs, but then your last ACL is deleted, you essentially open up your Kafka clusters to all users.
        - If youâ€™re using this option to disable ACLs, exercise caution: if someone adds an ACL, all the users who previously had access will lose that access.
